Dr Li Xiangwei is a Design Engineer at Avnet Asia in Singapore. His major work is to develop advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and their FPGA implementations. 

From September 2020 to July 2020, he worked as a Research Fellow at School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), under the supervision of [Associate Professor Douglas Maskell](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ASDOUGLAS). From July 2019 to July 2020, He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at School of Electrical and Information Engineering, [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/), under the supervision of [Professor Philip H.W. Leong](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/philip.leong.php). From December 2018 to July 2019, he worked as a Research Scientist at [Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc). His major work was to design and implement efficient parallel architectures for low precision deep neural networks (DNNs) and streaming fashion applications such as automatic modulation classification (AMC) and object detection. He has solid hands-on experience of system level FPGA design and machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Vitis-AI. 

Earlier than that, he got the Ph.D. degree in 2018 from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), under the supervision of [Associate Professor Douglas Maskell](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ASDOUGLAS). His research was mainly focusing on reconfigurable computing, specifically time-multiplexed FPGA overlay design. 

Prior to the Ph.D., he obtained the M.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) with Credit in 2014, and the B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from [Shanghai University](http://en.shu.edu.cn/) with Honors in 2011.
