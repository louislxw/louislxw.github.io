Dr Li Xiangwei is a Research Fellow at School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), under the supervision of [Associate Professor Douglas Maskell](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ASDOUGLAS). From July 2019 to July 2020, He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at School of Electrical and Information Engineering, [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/), under the supervision of [Professor Philip H.W. Leong](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/philip.leong.php). From December 2018 to July 2019, he worked as a Research Scientist at [Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc). His major work was to efficiently implement low precision deep neral networks (DNNs) and streaming fashion applications on FPGAs. He has solid hands-on experience of TensorFlow, PyTorch, PYNQ and Vitis-AI. 

Earlier than that, he got the Ph.D. degree in 2018 from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), under the supervision of [Associate Professor Douglas Maskell](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ASDOUGLAS). His research is mainly focusing on reconfigurable computing, specifically time-multiplexed FPGA overlay design. 

Prior to the Ph.D., he obtained the M.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) with Credit in 2014, and the B.Eng. in Communication Engineering from [Shanghai University](http://en.shu.edu.cn/) with Honors in 2011.
